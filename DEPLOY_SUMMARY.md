## 💡 Do You Need Render?

**No, you don't need Render** for this project because:

1. **Static Frontend Only**: The game is pure HTML/CSS/JS
2. **No Backend**: No server-side code to run
3. **No Database**: Game state is client-side only
4. **Vercel is Perfect**: Optimized for static sites

**When you'd need Render:**
- If you had a Node.js/Python backend
- If you needed a database
- If you had API endpoints
- If you needed WebSocket servers

For this project, **Vercel is all you need!**
